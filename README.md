## Data Scraping Process
I used the GitHub Search API to find user IDs of Hyderabad users with over 50 followers. I then retrieved user details using the User API and collected repository data through provided links. The process was broken down into steps to prevent throttling and ensure consistent data collection, preventing loss in progress.

## Most Interesting and Surprising Fact
A deep dive into hireable GitHub users in Hyderabad revealed JavaScript and Python as top choices, with HTML and Jupyter Notebook also being popular. Surprisingly, developers in top companies use these plus C++, CSS, and Dockerfile, highlighting broader tech preferences.

## Actionable Recommendation
Developers should expand their skills beyond popular tech like JavaScript and Python. Embracing additional tools like C++, CSS, and Dockerfile, commonly used by professionals in leading firms, can set them apart and boost their hiring potential in the competitive tech industry.
